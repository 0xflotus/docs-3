# IPFS FAQ

## What is IPFS?

IPFS stands for the InterPlanetary File System - a peer-to-peer network for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data in a distributed file system. 

To learn more, see [this guide on “what is IPFS?”]({{<relref "introduction/overview.md">}}).


## Where can I see IPFS in action today?

https://awesome.ipfs.io/ is a good starting point to see the variety of projects using IPFS today. You can also add your own project here: https://github.com/ipfs/awesome-ipfs


## How do I get started with IPFS?

For installing and initializing IPFS, check out [this getting started guide]({{<relref "introduction/usage.md">}}).


## How do I start contributing to IPFS?

A great way to help out right now is to run a node or two and report any issues you have, ask questions about everything that isn’t obvious (to help us write better documentation) and if you’re feeling really helpful, write up short guides on anything you think might be useful. If you want to contribute code to either of the core IPFS implementations, please review the [Community Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Stop in and say hi on IRC at #ipfs on freenode too if you feel like chatting.
