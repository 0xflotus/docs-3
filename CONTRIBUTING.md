## Tools and Workflow

### Visual Studio Code

While you can use any text editor you want to create content, there are a few add-ons available for Microsoft's Visual Studio Code (VSCode) that make writing docs a lot easier. Here are a few extensions and add-ons that we use:

#### [Markdown lint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/vscode-markdownlint), _David Anson_

If you're only going to install one extension from this list, make it this one. This add-on points out the issues and inconsistencies within your writing and can warn you about any problems before you push your changes. This extension is handy as it keeps everyone on the same page in terms of styling and layout.

#### [Markdown all in one](https://github.com/yzhang-gh/vscode-markdown), _Yu Zhang_

While not essential, this extension contains a bunch of _quality of life_ improvements that make writing docs a bit easier.

### Grammar and spelling

Nobody writes perfect-content first time. Here are a few tools to make sure you're not pushing easy mistakes.

#### Grammarly

It might not be the most elegant or robust application available, but Grammarly can help fix some of the complex or easy to miss mistakes in your docs.

#### Hemmingway

This app helps to simplify your writing. It's easy to ramble on while writing, while not realizing your content has become difficult to read or unwieldy. Hemmingway stops that by telling you when your sentences are too long or complicated.
