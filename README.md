## About this repo

This repo is used for two purposes:

1. To organize overall documentation work across the IPFS project, as managed by the **IPFS Documentation and Developer UX Working Group** ("Docs WG")
2. To host the documentation website for IPFS, available at https://docs.ipfs.io/

## Docs WG Q4 2019 update

After a busy and productive Q3 2019, the Docs WG is looking forward to putting into action a lot of the research and strategic work we accumulated over the summer and early autumn ‚Äî as well as continue apace with more immediate/tactical improvements to the existing IPFS docs landscape. Our goals for Q4 2019 are below, and you'll notice that they include (among other things) execution and support work for one major development: launching a new beta docs platform to eventually replace docs.ipfs.io. In parallel, we're also queuing up improvements to a variety of documentation items ‚Äî and types of items.

Want to be a beta tester for the new docs platform? We'd love to have you take part. [Let us know!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LVaD1B2uyW6Ff0jfU_iQ5mCeyQcHfyQO6BDD99XAgK0)

## Want to get involved with IPFS documentation?

We're undergoing major renovation to our docs in Q4 2019, but we would still **love ‚ù§Ô∏è your help** to improve existing items or make new ones even better! Here are some ideas to get you started:

1. **Join us on our weekly call!** See the top of this readme for full details on how and when.

2. **Claim an issue labeled "help wanted" in either [this docs repo](https://github.com/ipfs/docs/labels/help%20wanted) or [the IPFS website repo](https://github.com/ipfs/website/labels/help%20wanted)!** All our issues are T-shirt sized and roughly difficulty-graded (both using labels), so have a look for something that interests you in the time you have available, and dive on in! Leave your thoughts and questions in issue comments, and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.

3. **Create (or improve) an example, tutorial or concept guide!** At present, we have a variety of how-tos and concept guides either living in this docs repo, or linked to from the nav menu at [docs.ipfs.io](https://docs.ipfs.io). However, every new item we can offer makes it easier for the world's community to use and build on IPFS. If you'd like to write a new example/tutorial or concept guide, [take a look in our open issues](https://github.com/ipfs/docs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22OKR%3A+Content+Improvement%22) for items with the `OKR: Content Improvement` label and see if any already-identified needs appeal to you. If you'd like to write something entirely new, feel free ‚Äî PRs are welcome! Or, if you'd just like to improve existing docs content, feel free to fork it and add your suggestions.

4. **Help us improve how we present reference and API documentation.** As part of our beta docs platform launch, we're investigating the best way to improve how we present reference materials like API documentation and command-line dictionaries. Got thoughts? [Please discuss them!](https://github.com/ipfs/docs/issues/69)

If you're able to contribute to any of the categories above, we thank you in advance -- your work directly improves the future of IPFS for the global community! Before posting a PR with your changes, please be sure to check [our documentation style guide](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/DOCS_STYLEGUIDE.md) and the overall [IPFS contributor guidelines](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) so we can ensure that docs are clear, consistent, and simple to read. Finally, please make sure to follow the [IPFS code of conduct](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

## Just want to build the docs site?

### One-time setup

1. Install [AEgir](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aegir)

    ```sh
    npm install -g aegir
    ```

2. Download dependencies and IPFS libraries (e.g. go-ipfs, js-ipfs) and generate their documentation:

    ```sh
    make install
    ```

    This installs dependencies and generates source files from other projects (e.g. API documentation; theme resources from the `ipfs-css`, etc).

    When dependencies or external packages (like `go-ipfs`) have new releases, you should regenerate files based on them by running `make resources`.


### Build and run the site

* In the root directory, run `make dev`
* Load http://localhost:1313 in your web browser
* Edit and add things!

To create a production build, run `make build` instead. You‚Äôll find the final static site in the `public` directory.


### Why is this is a static site?

We believe in hosting IPFS‚Äôs documentation on IPFS, and that‚Äôs much easier when the content is static.
